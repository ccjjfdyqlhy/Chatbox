# Chatbox
a easy way to chat with your friends.  
Introduction:  
TCPserver.py-a server that you need to run first.  
TCPclient.py-a client that users can visit.
How to use:  
first, start the server, and then start the client on another computer.
then, input the server's IP into the client's tk entry box.  
so you can chat with others!
Happy using this code!
